### A Framework to Ensure Data Storage Security in Cloud Computing
In modern world data are the most important property for a company. Sarkar and Kumar (2017) suggest that we should pay more attention to data security on the cloud. The first reason is the customer cannot fully control their data, so it is not feasible to verify the data correctness. Second, the these data may be under high frequency usage condition, people should have solution to deal with cloud data loss. Third, most of the cloud storages are distributed storage, we need to assure that our data retrieved from different location can combine into correct data.
