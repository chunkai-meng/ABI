##### Deliverables:
+ The report must be professionally prepared (not hand written) with one and a half spacing, font size 11 or 12.  It must be your own work. When using other people’s work, references must be provided and there must not be any unacknowledged ‘cut and paste’.   

+ The report must therefore include a list of references (including web sites if appropriate), preferably you need to have at least 12 journal/conference papers, 4 books, and some websites. Seven of these papers need to be discussed in detail, at least one page per paper,  in Section 5 (see marking schedule). The rest could be used in referencing other topics, eg history,  details of technology, etc (see marking schedule for list of topics). To get a good grade, you must use and discuss the latest journal/conference papers and give less priority to websites. It is expected that the report size will be approximately 20 pages, although there is no limit on the size of the report.  

##### Please provide the following with your report:
+ Title page, one page abstract, table of contents, introduction (background and history of cloud computing), analysis of the growth in cloud computing (reasons, trend, etc), technical details (including network diagrams, bandwidth, product details, link details, size, latest research findings, etc.), summary of latest developments, discussions (analysis, why?, how?, future?, various options, advantages, dis-advantages, opportunities, comparison with other technologies, comparison of work of researchers on the topic, etc.), business and/or education and/or social impact, conclusions, references and appendices.  Comparison of work of latest researchers is most important.
